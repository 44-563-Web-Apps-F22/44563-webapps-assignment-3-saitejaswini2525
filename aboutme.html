        <h3>favorite movie</h3>
        <p>I watched the Tamil movie Alaipayuthey (Sakhi in Telugu) a few years ago. The film released in 2000 in Tamil, and was dubbed into my mother tongue, Telugu. I then watched it in Telugu, and rewatched it numerous times afterwards.The movie is a realistic love story between Karthik, portrayed by Madhavan and Santhi, portrayed by Shalini. (Character names in the Telugu version).</p>
